# Image-Color-Detection

This project utilizes Python and its libraries, such as Tkinter, PIL and ColorThief, to detect dominant colors in an image. The script processes the image, extracts color information, and identifies the most prominent hues, providing users with valuable insights into the image's color composition. The GitHub repository showcases the code and other images, enabling easy implementation and experimentation with the color detection algorithm. Enhance your image analysis capabilities and gain a deeper understanding of color patterns with this user-friendly Python project.
